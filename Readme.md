## Update Messages

### 12/22/2024
- **Launcher.py** has been created.  
  - Itâ€™s far from perfect and may not start Vape properly. If it doesnâ€™t start automatically, you can manually start it. At least the server will be running.  
- **Newer Video**: [Watch Here](https://archive.org/details/vape-v-4.mp-4)

### 12/21/2024
- **New Discord Server**: [Join Here](https://discord.gg/jFg7quHz)  
- **Environment Fixes**:  
  - Many users reported issues with the environment setup. The only reliable solution is to use the exact environment (ENV) from the first version/backup.  
  - A better tutorial or guide is in the works. For now, use the `env` folder as specified in the "VENV" instructions.  

**Quick Start**  
If you simply want to run the script without setting up a new environment, you can execute:  
```bash
env\Scripts\python.exe server.py
```

**Environment Files**  
Check the releases section for two downloadable files:  
- `env.zip`: Contains only the environment files (a copy of Python and all dependencies).  
- `full.zip`: A complete backup with the `venv` and everything pre-configured, ready to start.  

**Future Plans**  
- A simple launcher is being considered to make starting Vape easier.  
- The setup process has proven challenging for some users, and individual support is no longer feasible.  

**Key Learnings**  
1. The **Python version** is critical.  
2. Some dependencies must be updated or installed with the correct versions.  

For reference, a `freeze.txt` file (the result of running `pip freeze` in my environment) is included in both the `vape-v4` and `Lite` folders. This should help you identify the exact dependencies and versions required for the setup.

## Installation Tutorial

### Prerequisites
1. **Install Python 3.11**:  
   - Ensure you tick the "Add to path" checkbox at the bottom of the installation window before clicking "Install Now".  

2. **Disable Real-Time Protection**:  
   - Temporarily disable real-time protection in your antivirus software to prevent any installation conflicts.  

3. **Install Minecraft Forge**:  
   - Download and install Forge for the desired version of Minecraft and launch the game to complete the Forge setup.  

### Setup Instructions
Execute the following commands in your terminal to set up the environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository to your desired folder
git clone https://github.com/Kolhax/Vape-V4-Crack

# Install the virtual environment
pip install pyvenv
cd "Vape V4 Cracked"
py -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the server
py server.py
```

To Start The Server, After First Installation:
```bash
env\Scripts\activate.bat
py server.py
```

### Starting the Software
After the server is set up, proceed with the following steps to start the software:  
- Navigate to the "Vape_V4" folder, which should contain:  
  - `kangaroo patcher.exe`  
  - `Kangaroo.dll`  
  - `Vape.exe`  

- With the server running, drag and drop `Vape.exe` onto `Kangaroo patcher.exe`. Allow a few seconds for the process to complete. The software is now ready for use.
