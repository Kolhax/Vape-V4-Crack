I know I said I wouldn’t update this project anymore, but recently, I’ve received many friend requests reporting a new issue. I even encountered the same problem myself. The only reliable solution so far has been to use the exact environment (ENV) I had in my first version/backup.

To help with this, I’ll try to create a better tutorial or guide. In the meantime, I recommend using the `env` folder as specified in the "VENV" instructions.  

**Quick Start**  
If you simply want to run the script without setting up a new environment, you can execute:  
```bash
env\Scripts\python.exe server.py
```

**Environment Files**  
Check the releases section for two downloadable files:  
- `env.zip`: Contains only the environment files (a copy of Python and all dependencies).  
- `full.zip`: A complete backup with the `venv` and everything pre-configured, ready to start.  

Due to repository size and code clarity, the `env` folder is not included in the repository. You’ll need to create your own virtual environment if you don’t use the provided files.

**Future Plans**  
I’m considering making a simple launcher to help users start Vape more easily. Even with this "EZ crack," it seems some users still find the setup process challenging. Unfortunately, I can’t help everyone individually. I’ve already spent countless nights talking with users and even providing remote support via TeamViewer.  

**What I’ve Learned**  
1. The **Python version** is critical.  
2. Some dependencies must be updated or installed with the correct versions.  

For reference, I’ve included a `freeze.txt` file (the result of running `pip freeze` in my environment) in both the `vape-v4` and `Lite` folders. This should help you identify the exact dependencies and versions required for the setup.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.


## Installation Tutorial

### Prerequisites
1. **Install Python 3.9**:
   - Ensure you tick the "Add to path" checkbox at the bottom of the installation window before clicking "Install Now".

2. **Disable Real-Time Protection**:
   - Temporarily disable real-time protection in your antivirus software to prevent any installation conflicts.

3. **Install Minecraft Forge**:
   - Download and install Forge for the desired version of Minecraft and launch the game to complete the Forge setup.

### Setup Instructions
Execute the following commands in your terminal to set up the environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository to your desired folder
git clone https://github.com/Kolhax/Vape-V4-Crack

# Install the virtual environment
pip install pyvenv
cd "Vape V4 Cracked"
py -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the server
py server.py
```

To Start The Server, After First Installation:
```bash
env\Scripts\activate.bat
py server.py
```

### Starting the Software
After the server is set up, proceed with the following steps to start the software:
- Navigate to the "Vape_V4" folder, which should contain:
  - `kangaroo patcher.exe`
  - `Kangaroo.dll`
  - `Vape.exe`

- With the server running, drag and drop `Vape.exe` onto `Kangaroo patcher.exe`. Allow a few seconds for the process to complete. The software is now ready for use.
